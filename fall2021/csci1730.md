### Substitution:
```
fun f(x): x + 1
f(2)
```
1. x + 1 where x is replaced by 2
2. 2 + 1
3. 3


```
fun g(y): f(y + 4)
g(5)
```
1. f(y + 4) where y is replaced by 5
2. f(5 + 4)
3. f(9)
4. x + 1 where x is replaced by 9
5. 9 + 1
6. 10

```
fun h(z, w): g(z) + g(w)
h(6, 7)
```
ENVIRONMENT = data structure that keeps track of names and associated values (key-value pair; hashtable)
1. g(z) + g(w) where [z is replaced by 6, w is replaced by 7]
2. g(6) + g(7)
3. f(y + 4) + g(7) where [y is replaced by 6]
4. f(10) + g(7)
5. (x + 1) + g(7) where [x is replaced by 10]
6. (10 + 1) + g(7)
7. 11 + g(7)
8. 11 + f(y + 4) where [y is replaced by 7]
9. 11 + f(11)
10. 11 + (x + 1) where [x is replaced by 11]
11. 11 + 12
12. 23

* Surface syntax helps the user create underlying compiler data structures
    * **Parsing:** turns surface syntax into program representation
```

// parse...
(plus (num 1) (num 2))
```
